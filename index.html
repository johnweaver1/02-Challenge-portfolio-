                <p>Hi, my name is John. I'm currently working as an elective teacher in Austin.
                    I teach four class. TV, Film, and classes with coding in them! I teach stundets in 7th and 8th grade how to use basic 
                    HTML, CSS, and Javascript as springboard for more advanced classes! When I started learning to code,
                    because of my profession, I quickly started wanting to know more! Now I'm taking the UT bootcamp coding course to become proficent.
                    I can't wait to show off what I'm going to be learning!
                </p>
