                <p>Hi, my name is John. I'm currently working as an elective teacher in Austin.
                    I teach four class. TV, Film, and classes with coding in them! I teach stundets in 7th and 8th grade how to use basic 
                    HTML, CSS, and Javascript as springboard for more advanced classes! When I started learning to code,
                    because of my profession, I quickly started wanting to know more! Now I'm taking the UT bootcamp coding course to become proficent.
                    I can't wait to show off what I'm going to be learning!
                </p>

                    <p class ="pd">GitFund is a crowdfunding website where developers can support developers. Our goal was for users to create projects that other developrs would want financed, and could even contribute to! This project uses React in the front end with a Node.js and Express.js Server using Graphql. This is a MERN-stack single-page application that works with user inputed data. We hope you enjoy seeing a new way to help seniro and fledgling developers!
